## About Me

Hi! My name is Tanisha, and I am a rising third-year studying computer science, mathematics, and sociology at Oberlin College. I plan to graduate in May 2026. You can contact me at tshende316@gmail.com or tshende@oberlin.edu. 

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Dr. Abraham Glasser, a researcher at the Center for Accessibility and Inclusion Research at Gallaudet University. He develops and studies technologies for people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing. You can find his website [here](https://abrahamglasser.com/).

## About My Project

In general, the projects are about making extended reality, including virtual and augmented reality, more accessible to people who are Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH). One project is making workplace training simulations in VR or AR more accessible through haptics, interpreters, and automated captioning. Another is using haptics for sound-awareness and attention direction while wearing the headset.

The program will take us through each step of a research project, such as the literature review and methodology, so by the end of it, we'll have a paper, presentation, and poster that we can submit to conferences.
