title: Week 1

I spent the week adjusting to the program, hearing from the program directors and faculty mentors, meeting the other students, and starting my project. The transition was a bit difficult. I had final exams the week prior, I needed to figure out my food situation, and I didn't have time to learn ASL. It was nice to meet my mentor and become acquainted with our projects. I also connected with another mentor and her PhD student, so I'm excited to shadow that study as well.
